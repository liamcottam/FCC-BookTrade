          "For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. But only Hari Sheldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future--to a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save mankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire--both scientists and scholars--and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the Galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for a fututre generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation. But soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding Empire. Mankind's last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and be overrun--or fight them and be destroyed.",

          "B-boying is a form of Afro-diasporic competitive dance that developed in the Bronx, NY in the early 1970s. Widely - though incorrectly - known as \"breakdancing,\" it is often dismissed as a form of urban acrobatics set to music. In reality, however, b-boying is a deeply traditional and profoundly expressive art form that has been passed down from teacher to student for almost four decades. Foundation: B-boys, B-girls and Hip-Hop Culture in New York offers the first serious study of b-boying as both unique dance form and a manifestation of the most fundamental principles of hip-hop culture. Drawing on anthropological and historical research, interviews and personal experience as a student of the dance, Joseph Schloss presents a nuanced picture of b-boying and its social context. From the dance's distinctive musical repertoire and traditional educational approaches to its complex stylistic principles and secret battle strategies, Foundation illuminates a previously unexamined thread in the complex tapestry that is contemporary hip-hop.",

          "This new edition of the Oxford Handbook for the Foundation Programme provides everything you need to excel in your first two years as a doctor. Building on the success of the previous editions, and the valuable feedback from junior and senior doctors, the third edition has been extensively revised and updated. The handbook is now in full colour, which has been used to make the facts stand out and to simplify navigation to the right page. The sections on prescribing and drug doses, emergencies, and clinical medicine have been expanded and reordered. This includes the addition of a 'pharmacopeia' with key information for commonly-prescribed drugs including dose, contraindications, and key side-effects. Along with the latest in clinical practice, the handbook includes the parts of the job rarely covered at medical school such as day-to-day life on the wards, referrals, clerking patients, procedures, and hospital paperwork, as well as providing advice on ethics, communication, and what to do when things go wrong. The handbook has practical tips on the current career system, Foundation Programme requirements, MMC, completing your portfolio, interviews, application forms, and how to get published. With practical advice from the authors' personal experience, and key evidence-based clinical information. This handbook is the ultimate quick-reference survival guide to the Foundation Programme and is indispensible for all junior doctors.",

While it is a book about computers, Understanding Computers and Cognition goes beyond the specific issues of what computers can or can't do. It is a broad-ranging discussion exploring the background of understanding in which the discourse about computers and technology takes place. Understanding Computers and Cognition is written for a wide audience, not just those professionals involved in computer design or artificial intelligence. It represents an important contribution to the ongoing discussion about what it means to be a machine, and what it means to be human.",

The revised edition goes even further in its presentation of how best to assess and support both children and adults with low vision and plan programs and services that optimize their functional vision and ability to lead productive and satisfying lives, based on individuals' actual abilities. Part 1, Personal and Professional Perspectives, provides the foundations of this approach, with chapters focused on the anatomy of the eye, medical causes of visual impairment, optics and low vision devices, and clinical low vision services, as well as psychological and social implications of low vision and the history of the field. Part 2 focuses on children and youths, providing detailed treatment of functional vision assessment, instruction, use of low vision devices, orientation and mobility, and assistive technology. Part 3 presents rehabilitation and employment issues for working-age adults and special considerations for older adults.",
